# About

This finance tracker will allow users to:

- Log their daily income, expense, and transfer transactions.
- Have a birds-eye-view of all of their accounts.
- Get an idea on how much they earn and spend on a daily and monthly basis, as well as where this money is earned or spent.
- Add, edit, and delete accounts and categories.
- Switch between light and dark theme based on their preferences.

I'd like to add a React.js application in my portfolio, and this Finance Tracker is perfect since I also planned to learn more about React.js, to use different libraries that are commonly used, and to learn about styling using CSS-in-JS.

This side project is heavily inspired by the finance tracker that I personally use, which is [Money Manager Expense & Budget by Realbyte Inc.](https://www.realbyteapps.com/)
